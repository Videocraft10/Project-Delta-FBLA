# What is Project Delta?
Project Delta is an ARPG game made in Unreal Engine that aims to tell a story while being a hi-fi action fighting game.

The theme this year was to challenge the player with ethical challenges and have multiple endings.

You are Frank, a 19-year-old whose family lives out in the desert, away from the big city. Your parents don't believe in this "imortaitly" stuff and are still mortal, and so are you. However, as expected, there aren't many job opportunities in the middle of nowhere, so you take a leap, say goodbye to your parents, and travel to the big city. Since you haven't graduated college, you work as a janitor in one of Omega Corp's Iota Cities. These are moving behemoths that can traverse the land to search for more resources to plunder. While cleaning, you see an unlocked staff room. Upon further inspection, you think you may have found something very important that you shouldn't have...
